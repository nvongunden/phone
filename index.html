Okay perfect!. So they have me reaching out to you to go over how to make a claim on the policy and just a couple other things you are responsible for as the beneficiary. Does that make sense?
<br>
<br>
<b>YES:</b> Okay perfect and then did you have a spouse as well? This is going to pay out to your family so they want to make sure both of you have this information just in case.
<br><b>NO:</b> Gotcha so the reason that they have us reaching out is because last year over 7 million dollars went unclaimed and that is the absolute last thing we want, is for <span class="VERBALChar sponsorDisplay">Sponsor</span> to get this get up and his family isn't able to be paid out on it</div>

    <span>I can understand how you feel about that. However, the police tell us that when a child goes missing it takes parents up to 5 hours to gather this vital information in order to organize the search to find the child ALIVE. This Child Safe Kit is designed to minimize the time to locate them. It's my job to deliver the Child Safe Kits and explain the Family Care Program. &rarr; <span class="smallfont">(Quickly back to script)</span></span></p>

    <p><span class="ConditionalChar">What is this all about?</span><br>
    <span>This is about the Child Safe Kits that you (requested online/were sponsored) for by (Referrer). The Child Safe Kits are basically fingerprint kits for your kids. If they ever go missing, you'll be able to use these kits to help find them faster. &rarr; <span class="smallfont">(Quickly back to script)</span></span></p>

    <p><span class="ConditionalChar">I already have a child safe kit</span><br>
    <span>That's exactly why I'm calling! They went digital now so everyone is getting an update. Once we explain the new Child Safe Kits, you'll scan a unique QR code to set up your Child Safe Kits.

    <p><span class="ConditionalChar">Can you mail it to me?</span><br>
    <span>We used to mail them but we found out that not everyone was filling them out correctly or at all. Once we explain the Child Safe Kits, you'll scan a unique QR code to set up your Child Safe Kits. This ensures that every parent fills them out properly and improves the effectiveness of the Amber Alert system. &rarr; <span class="smallfont">(Quickly back to script)</span></span></p>

    <p><span class="ConditionalChar">How much does this cost?</span><br>
    <span>Lucky you! Since you requested these kits online when you did, they are at no cost to you!  <span class="smallfont">(back to script)</span><br>
